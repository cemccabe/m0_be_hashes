# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

    **I struggled with differentiating the syntax between a colon and a hash rocket. However, the post Katie made clarifying the difference was very helpful and allowed me to cruise through the exercises.**

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

    **My notes are saving me at the moment. I've found creating mini cheat sheets of commands or terms I'm unfamiliar with allows me to reference them quickly as well as ingrain them into my memory faster. I'll generally take the most helpful notes while reading through a lesson the second time - I find I know what I want to emphasize that way.**

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

    **While I love to experiment and play around with code after I understand it, if I am trying to solve a problem, I tend to go to Google quickly to get a grasp of the situation. After that, I'll go back to trial and error.**
